# CAT: Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork

**CAT (Communication in Ad Hoc Teamwork)** is a framework for studying and developing agents capable of effective collaboration in dynamic, ad hoc teams. This environment introduces the **Tool Fetching Domain**, a testbed specifically designed to explore explicit communication strategies in teamwork scenarios where agents may not share prior coordination or knowledge.

## ðŸ§  Overview

CAT provides a variety of algorithms and tools for experimenting with explicit communication between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings. The framework emphasizes sequential decision-making, limited inquiries, and the value of communication in collaborative environments.

The environment and research in this project are grounded in the following key papers:

- Mirsky, R., Macke, W., Wang, A., Yedidsion, H., & Stone, P. (2020). *A penny for your thoughts: The value of communication in ad hoc teamwork*. International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
- Macke, W., Mirsky, R., & Stone, P. (2020). *Query Content in Sequential One-shot Multi-Agent Limited Inquiries when Communicating in Ad Hoc Teamwork*. Workshop on Distributed and Multi-Agent Planning (DMAP), ICAPS.
